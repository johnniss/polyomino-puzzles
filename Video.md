# Link to a presentation of the polyomino app on YouTube 

Most of the prsentation is from a user point of view where no APL insight is required.

Presentation of my Polyomino App on DYALOG APL seminar, in Elsinore Denmark, september 2017.

# Synopsis

In 2 dimensions, a polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more congruent squares edge to edge; 

in 3 dimensions, cubes are used instead of squares and joined side by side. 

In this talk, John discusses multi-dimensional polyominoes, and not only enumerating and visualising polyominoes, 
but also for creating and solving puzzles in 0-4 dimensions, where polyominoes are used as pieces.
